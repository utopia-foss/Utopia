    # Initial state
    initial_state: single_s0   # can be: random, fraction, single_s0, single_s1
    # Explanation:
    #   - random:             each strategy occurs with probability 0.5
    #   - fraction:           s1_fraction of all cells have strategy 1
    #   - single_s0:          single cell at the center has strategy 0
    #   - single_s1:          single cell at the center has strategy 1
