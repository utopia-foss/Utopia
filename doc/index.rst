Welcome to Utopia!
==================

Utopia is a comprehensive modelling framework for complex and evolving systems.
It is tailored to build models based on cellular automata (CA), agent-based models (ABMs), and network models.
Utopia provides tools for implementing a model, configuring and performing simulation runs, and evaluating the resulting data.
Additionally, several readily implemented models are shipped with Utopia.
