#Issues

- CopyMeModel not consisitent with CopyMe (replace all does not work if Model contained in Name) [CopyMe.cc line 20 and 27] 
- what's an Enum? [CopyMe.hh]
- choose Boundary Condition. Which keyword to choose periodic or const state
- Boundary let me think of boundary Condition "periodic / const"
- bounds or ticks? [in SimpleEG spatial.py plot_property(...)]
- step_size not working in SimpleEG spatial.py -> use for t in range(0,steps, step_size)


#Cook Book
- took me very log to get plotting working (spatial movie as in SimpleEG), because plot function in SimpleEG complicated.
