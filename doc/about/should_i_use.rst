Should I Use Utopia?
====================

You might ask yourself: "Why not use `NetLogo <https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml>`_?"
Here's why:

- Utopia is written in modern C++ and Python, and allows developers to exploit the full potential of both programming languages.
- Utopia offers tools to perform parameter sweeps of models and analyze their high-dimensional data efficiently.
- Utopia includes a multithreading interface and can execute simulations concurrently on distributed cluster nodes.
- Utopia supports and encourages software engineering workflows, including version control, unit testing, and more.

On the other hand, you should *not* use Utopia, if

- Programming and using the command line is not your thing; *Utopia embraces flexibility for programmers.*
- You want a library with a simple and concise feature set; *Utopia is feature-rich and extensive.*
- You want a *very* quick solution; *Utopia has a steep learning curve.*
