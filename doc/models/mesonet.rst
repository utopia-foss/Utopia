``mesonet`` â€” Model of Consumer-Resource Systems
================================================

``mesonet`` models the interaction of consumer species with the resources in their environment.

This implementation is preceded by a `Python implementation <https://ts-gitlab.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/yunus/mesonet>`_ of the same name, where the interactions were represented using a network.
The present Utopia implementation foregoes the network approach; while this restricts interactions to the consumer-resource scenario, the implementation is simpler, faster, and allows to explore other aspects of the model.
