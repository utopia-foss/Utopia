.. _model_CopyMeBare:

``CopyMeBare`` - The bare basics for your new model
===================================================

This template model supplies the bare basics needed for a Utopia model implementation:

* The ``Model`` base class
* Minimal configuration files for the model and its plots
* A template documentation file
* Python modules for model *testing* and *evaluation*

Use this model if you want to start "from scratch" but want to avoid setting up the infrastructure itself.

.. hint::

    Refer to :ref:`impl_step_by_step` for information on how to implement your own model based on this template.
