``SandPile`` model
==============

The SandPile model simulates the development of a sand pile when you add a grain of send at the time. There is a critical level for the slope of the sendpile that causes it  to relax and distibute sandgrains on the surranding cells.

The model is based on the description in the CCEES Lecture Notes by Kurt Roth in chapter 7.3 (Discrete Complex Systems - Contact Processes). See there for an in-depth theory and simulation results.
