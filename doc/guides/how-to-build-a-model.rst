How to Implement Your Own Model in Utopia
=========================================

After having been through the :doc:`README <../README>` and the
:doc:`tutorial <tutorial>`, this guide is for creating a new model in *Utopia*.

.. note::

  As a model developer, you can **not** use the Utopia docker image, as it does not contain the model source code.

If you go through all the steps, you will end up with a model that can profit
from all *Utopia* features and can do ... basically nothing interesting yet.
It is a **starting point** for your own expedition into the *Utopia* world.
You will be the one who afterwards defines the rules, the entities etc. of
that world.

To that end, there are three models supplied that can be used as a basis for
new models, the so-called ``CopyMe`` models.
They not only showcase some Utopia functionality, but also provide good
starting conditions for different scenarios:

    * ``CopyMeGrid``: A basic Cellular Automaton model.

        * Already includes the ``CellManager``.
        * Recommended if you want to work with a Cellular Automaton

    * ``CopyMeGraph``: A basic graph model.

        * Already includes a graph and example functionality
        * Recommended if you want to work with a graph

    * ``CopyMeBare``: The bare basics. Really.

        * Recommended if you do not need a Cellular Automaton or a Graph.
        * Recommended if you are proficient with Utopia.

You should now decide with which model you want to start with.
This can be one of the above ``CopyMe`` models or some other model.

‚ö†Ô∏è Below, you will need to replace all mentions of ``CopyMe`` with the name of the model of your choice.
  

Choosing a name for your model
------------------------------
This is the point where you should decide on the name of your new Utopia model.

For the purpose of this guide, we assume you want to implement a model called ``MyFancyModel``.
Probably, you will give it a more suitable name.
So, keep in mind to replace every ``MyFancyModel`` below with the actual model name.

.. note::

    Utopia has a naming convention for models.
    Your model name should consist of words that start with Capital Letters and are ``DirectlyConcatenatedWithoutSeparatingSymbols``.

    Also, you should not include the ``Model`` string into the name, e.g.: you *should* name your model ``ForestFire`` rather than ``ForestFireModel``.
    (So... ``MyFancyModel`` is actually not the best example ;))


Setting Up The Infrastructure
-----------------------------
Ok, let's get started by setting up the model infrastructure.
The following will involve a lot of copying and renaming, so make sure to be concentrated.

.. hint::

    The Utopia CLI provides a command to do all the copying, renaming of files, and refactoring of file content:

    .. code-block:: bash

        (utopia-env) $ utopia models copy ModelToCopy --new-name MyFancyModel

    If you let the CLI do this step for you, most of the steps below are already covered.
    It still makes sense to go through the individual steps and read the remarks, such that you get an idea of what the CLI tool actually did.

    See ``utopia models copy --help`` for more usage information.

    **For CCEES Group Members:** To copy to the ``utopia/models`` repository, the target project name need be ``UtopiaModels``.
    If this does not work, make sure that the ``utopia/models`` repository on your machine is up-to-date with the latest master and you invoked ``cmake ..`` after the update.


To avoid problems, go through the following points from top to bottom, and first read all of the instructions of one step before starting to carry them out.

.. note::

    The steps in this guide are numbered; if you run into problems and ask for
    help, you can name the step you got stuck at.


1. Move to the ``src/utopia/models`` directory inside the ``utopia`` repository.

2. Copy the ``CopyMe`` directory and paste it in the same directory.

    .. note::

        **Important!** If you are a CCEES group member, you should **not** paste into the ``src/utopia/models`` directory in the ``utopia`` repository (which holds the framework code), but into the corresponding ``src/models`` directory inside the group-internal `models repository <https://ts-gitlab.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/utopia/models>`_.

3. Rename the copied directory to ``MyFancyModel`` (or rather, your chosen
   name).

4. Rename all the files inside of the newly created directory such that all
   occurrences of ``CopyMe`` are replaced by ``MyFancyModel``.

  - You can do so by using the `parameter expansion capabilities <http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/syntax/pe>`_ of BASH:
  Inside your model directory, call

  .. code-block:: bash

    for file in CopyMe*; do mv $file ${file/CopyMe/MyFancyModel}; done

5. Tell *Utopia* that there is a new model, e.g. include your model in the
   Utopia CMake build routine:

  - In ``src/utopia/models/``, you find a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file. Open it and let
    CMake find your model directory by including the command:
    ``add_subdirectory(MyFancyModel)`` 
  - In ``src/utopia/models/MyFancyModel/``, there is another ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.
    Open it and change the line ``add_model(CopyMe CopyMe.cc)`` to
    ``add_model(MyFancyModel MyFancyModel.cc)``. With this command, you tell
    CMake that a new model should be kept track of.

6. Open the file ``MyFancyModel.cc`` in the ``src/utopia/models/MyFancyModel/``
   directory and do the following:

  - Throughout the file, replace all ``CopyMe``'s by ``MyFancyModel``'s.

7. Open the file ``MyFancyModel.hh`` in the ``src/utopia/models/MyFancyModel/``
   directory and do the following:

  - Throughout the file, replace all ``CopyMe``\ 's by ``MyFancyModel``\ 's.
  - Throughout the file, replace all ``COPYME``\ 's by ``MYFANCYMODEL``\ 's.

8. Open the ``MyFancyModel_plots.yml`` and ``MyFancyModel_base_plots.yml`` files in the ``src/utopia/models/MyFancyModel/`` directory and do the following:

  - Throughout the files, replace all ``CopyMe``\ 's by ``MyFancyModel``\ 's.

9. Open the file ``MyFancyModel_cfg.yml`` in the ``src/utopia/models/MyFancyModel/``
   directory and do the following:

  - Throughout the file, replace all ``CopyMe``\ 's by ``MyFancyModel``\ 's.

It's time for a little check if everything works as desired. For that, follow
these steps

10. Enter the ``build`` directory and run ``cmake ..``
11. Check that the CMake log contains ``Registered model target: MyFancyModel``
12. Now execute ``make MyFancyModel`` ...

  * Are there errors? Hmmm... check above that you adjusted everything as
    described.
  * Building succeeds? Congratulations! üéâ

13. Use the command line interface to run the model:

  .. code-block:: bash

     cd build
     source ./activate
     utopia run MyFancyModel

Hoping that everything went well so far, let's continue with setting up the
testing and plotting framework...

The Python Testing Framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set up a simple Python testing framework in the following way:

12. Move to the ``python/model_tests`` directory
13. Copy the ``CopyMe`` directory and rename it to ``MyFancyModel``. Make sure
    that there is a file named ``__init__.py`` inside the directory. 
14. Inside the created ``MyFancyModel`` directory, rename the
    ``test_CopyMe.py`` file to ``test_MyFancyModel.py``.
15. Open the ``test_MyFancyModel.py`` file and replace all ``CopyMe``\ 's
    by ``MyFancyModel``\ 's.

In this ``test_MyFancyModel.py`` file you can add tests to your model.
You have the full capabilities of `pytest <https://pytest.org>`_ available plus
the ``utopya.testtools`` module (as exemplified in the ``CopyMe`` model tests.)

.. note::

  Remember to remove the provided example tests if you remove unneeded parts
  of the former ``CopyMe`` model. Otherwise, you will get error messages when
  running the model.


Custom Model Plots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As you saw in the :doc:`tutorial <tutorial>`, it is possible to have custom
model plots which are tailored to the data your model is producing.
You can set them up in the following way:

16. Move to the ``python/model_plots`` directory
17. Copy the ``CopyMe`` directory and rename it to ``MyFancyModel``. Make sure
    that there is a file named ``__init__.py`` inside the directory.

The ``*_plots.yml`` files you copied alongside the model configuration control
the behavior of the plotting framework. In the ``MyFancyModel_plots.yml`` file,
you can specify which plots are to be performed automatically.

The ``state.py`` script is provided to show you how a model specific plotting
script could look like.
In ``generic.py`` you see some examples of generic plotting functions which can
be used in combination with Utopia's :ref:`data transformation and selection
framework <external_plot_creator_DAG_support>`.

When starting to implement more plots, you should definitely have a look at
the :doc:`detailed plotting documentation <../frontend/plotting>`!

.. note::

    Once you change parts of the former ``CopyMe`` model code, the plots might
    break and you might get errors during plot creation. To alleviate them,
    either adapt the plotting functions, remove them, or temporary disable
    them in the plot configuration (using ``enabled: false``) until you have
    adapted them.



Adapting your code
------------------
Depending on what model you want to implement, you will need to delete or
adapt some provided functions. So, feel free to remove anything, you do not
need.

* All variables, functions, etc. that are just there to show how you would use and implement them are denoted with the prefix ``some_`` or ``_some``\ , e.g. ``_ some_variable``\ , ``some_function``\ , ``some_interaction``\ , ...
  If you write your model, you should change these.
* Keep in mind to adapt the plotting and testing functions such that they belong to your model.

Some Final Remarks and Advice
-----------------------------

Inspiration from other models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you want to learn more about the capabilities of Utopia and how models can
look like, we recommend that you have a look at the already implemented models
in the ``src/utopia/models`` directory.


``log->debug`` instead of ``std::cout``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are used to writing ``C++`` code you probably often use ``std::cout``
to print information or to debug your code. We advice you to use the
functionality of ``spdlog`` if you work with *Utopia*. This has at least two
advantages:

* If you run your model, your information is stored in a ``out.log`` for each
  universe, so you can have a look at the logger information later.
* If you do big parameter sweeps, your terminal will not be flooded with
  information.

As a rough guideline:

* Use ``log->info("Some info")`` for information that is not repetitive, e.g.
  not inside a loop, and contains rather general information.
* Use ``log->debug("Some more detailed info, e.g. for helping you debug")`` 
* Use the python-like formatting syntax:
  ``log->debug("Some parameter: {:.3f}", param)`` to output parameters.

More information about how to use ``spdlog``, what functionality is provided,
and formatting schemes can be found
`in their documentation <https://github.com/gabime/spdlog>`_.

Monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^
Utopia models have the ability to communicate the model's current state to the
frontend, e.g. the number of cells with a certain state, or the density of
agents or the like.
This is done only after a certain ``monitor_emit_interval``\ , to save
computing resources. As this data is communicated to the frontend via
``std::cout``, try to keep it to the bare minimum.

For examples, check out the ``monitor`` function of the ``CopyMe`` model.


Finished!
---------
Congratulations, you have build a new model! :)

Your next guide will be the :doc:`model requirements <model-requirements>`.
It contains information what requirements your code must fulfill such that it
can be accepted as a model within *Utopia*, e.g. that it can be merged into
*Utopia*'s ``master`` branch.

Have fun implementing your own *Utopia* model! :)
