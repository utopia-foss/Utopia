Backend
=======

The Utopia backend, i.e. the  ``utopia/core`` and ``utopia/data_io`` libraries, provide a number of supporting structures that help in model implementation and data writing.
The FAQs below contain information on both the C++ use of these features as well as their integration and configuration.

Please also refer to the :ref:`C++ documentation <cpp_docs>`.
