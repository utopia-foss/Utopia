### My Model Works Guide

#### Trust Is Good, Control Is Better

Your code seems to work fine? We are sure, it does! But with automatic tests you can objectively proof to the utopia community that it really does what you want it to do! So...

- [ ] Have you added tests to check whether the different parts of your model really work?

#### Everyone wants to Really Understand What You have Created, Including yourself!

- [ ] The code is commented. Here, three aspects are important: 
    1) Write the comments for a stranger (could be you in a year), who needs to understand what the code does, and 
    2) Don't comment obvious actions that you mostly can extract by just reading the code itself, but rather explain the underlying ideas
    3) Check whether you have overwritten, deleted or adapted the comments concerning the `CopyMe` model
- [ ] You have filled the `README.md` with content, so that everyone understands, what the code does and what your thoughts and motivations behind the modeling decisions were.

There are many reasons to require both from you and your model. We just want to emphasize two of them:
1. We understand your ideas and your model more easily. Therefore, your model can be easier maintained, reused and expanded, but more importantly
2. You understand better what you are designing and building because you constantly need to reflect on your decisions.
