      # Specify the colormap
      # This can be done in two ways:
      #   1. use a matplotlib colormap such as 'viridis'
      #   2. provide a dictionary from which a discrete colormap
      #      is derived. The keys correspond to the labels,
      #      and the values define the color
      cmap: Greens
