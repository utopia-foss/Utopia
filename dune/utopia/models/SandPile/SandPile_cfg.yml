# The model configuration for the SandPile model
#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration and needs to be
# written such that it can be used by _every_ model instance, regardless
# of the level within a model hierarchy.
# 
# To that end, it needs to specify the parameters at the level of the instance
# of a Model class.
# 
# This file is usually handled by the frontend: usage of advanced yaml features
# like anchors and tags is supported.
# 
# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single
# instance. Therefore, parameter sweeps should not be specified here!
# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make
# sure that no circular includes occur.

# --- Space parameters --------------------------------------------------------
# The physical space this model is embedded in
space:
  periodic: false

# --- CellManager -------------------------------------------------------------
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 16      # in cells per unit length of physical space
    # NOTE A large number of cells can make the initialization take a while...

  neighborhood:
    mode: vonNeumann

# --- Dynamics ----------------------------------------------------------------
# The initial slope range.
initial_slope: [5, 6]
# Cells are randomly initialized using a uniform distribution in the given
# closed range. The first value is the lower limit and the second one the
# upper limit of the slope.

# The critical slope; beyond this value, sand topples
critical_slope: 4
