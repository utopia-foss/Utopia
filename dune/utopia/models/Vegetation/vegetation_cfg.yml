#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration. It should specify
# all available parameters and their default values.
# These should be specified under the `parameter_space` key.
#
# This file should NOT be used to overwrite any other parts of the utopya
# configuration.
# 
# As this file is (usually) handled by the frontend, it is possible to use
# yaml features like anchors, inheritance, ...
