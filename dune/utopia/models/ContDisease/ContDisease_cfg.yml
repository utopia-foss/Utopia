# The model configuration for the ContDisease model
#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration and needs to be
# written such that it can be used by _every_ model instance, regardless
# of the level within a model hierarchy.
#
# To that end, it needs to specify the parameters at the level of the instance
# of a Model class.
#
# This file is usually handled by the frontend: usage of advanced yaml features
# like anchors and tags is supported.
#
# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single
# instance. Therefore, parameter sweeps should not be specified here!
# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make
# sure that no circular includes occur.

# --- Grid parameters ---
# Extensions in x and y direction
grid_size: [64, 64]

# Periodic boundary conditions? false: cells at boundary have fewer neighbors
periodic: false


# --- Initialization parameters ---
# Initial state of the whole grid. 
# Possible values: empty, init_density
initial_state: init_density
initial_density: 0.5    # uniform initial_density

# Infection source - set true to activate.
infection_source: true

# Define infection source location. Can be: south
infection_source_loc: south

# Stones - set true to activate.
stones: true

# Initialization mode for stones (can be: random)
stone_init: random

# Additional parameters for stone initialization
stone_density: 0.1   # stone density in entire grid
stone_cluster: 0.2   # how much stones prefer to form clusters


# --- Parameters controlling the dynamics ---
# Probablity for tree growth in each time step, per cell
p_growth: 0.0075

# Probablity for an infected cell to infect a cell in the neighborhood
p_infect: 1.

# Probaility for random point infection of a tree
p_rd_infect: 0.
