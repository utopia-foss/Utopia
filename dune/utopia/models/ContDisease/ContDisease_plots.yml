      # Specify the colormap
      # This can be done in two ways:
      #   1. use a matplotlib colormap such as 'viridis'
      #   2. provide a dictionary from which a discrete colormap
      #      is derived. The keys correspond to the labels,
      #      and the values define the color
      # cmap: viridis
      cmap: 
        empty: white
        tree: green
        infected: red
        herd: orange
