# Copy Me

The `CopyMe` model is just a template model, which helps you create a new model. This template `README` is just a proposition, but you can use your own creativity and structure to convey the important information about your model in a nice and catchy way. Feel free to add or delete new sections.

## Fundamentals

Here, you can add some description of the fundamental ideas of your model and the questions it potentially can address.

### Subchapter of the Fundamentals

Here, important subaspects of the model can be addressed.

## Implementation Details

This section provides a few important implementation details.

### First Crucial Detail

### Second Detail: If You Try to Implement This Model, You Will Surely Have This Problem

And I solved it! Look here...

## Simulation Results â€“ A Selection Process

it is always nice to have some small (!) pictures or videos which show some interesting simulation results.

## More Conceptual and Theoretical Background

Models normally are based on a lot of theory. Here, you can mention or explain some of it. Further, you can refer to important papers and/or books.

### Theory of Template Models

I am actually not so sure, if there is a lot of theory behind this...

### Theory of Everything

## Possible Future Extensions

You have a nice idea, but

1. that would open a completely new storyline and thus would need the creation of a new model that is based on this one.
2. you just did not have the time to explore everything, however, it would probably be a good idea to look into this in future work.
