# The model configuration for the dummy model
#
# NOTE: This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration and needs
# to be written such that it can be used by _every_ model instance, regardless
# of the level within a model hierarchy.
# 
# To that end, it needs to specify the parameters at the level of the instance
# of a Model class.
# It should NOT include anything that is related to a _run_ of a simulation.
# Specifically: parameter sweeps should NEVER EVER be specified here! The place
# to configure a sweep is in the run configuration.
# 
# This file is handled by the frontend: usage of advanced yaml features like
# anchors and tags is supported. However, if including other models' parameters
# via the `!model` tag, make sure that no circular includes occur.
