# The model configuration for the SimpleEG model
#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration. It should specify
# all available parameters and their default values.
# These should be specified under the `parameter_space` key.
#
# This file should NOT be used to overwrite any other parts of the utopya
# configuration.
# 
# As this file is (usually) handled by the frontend, it is possible to use
# yaml features like anchors, inheritance, ...

    # Model parameters ........................................................
    # Grid parameters
    grid_size: [127, 127]
    periodic: true          # false: cells at boundary have fewer neighbors

    # Initial state
    initial_state: random   # can be: random, fraction, single_s0, single_s1
    s1_fraction: 0.5        # only used for 'fraction' initial state
    # Explanation:
    #   - random:             each strategy occurs with probability 0.5
    #   - fraction:           s1_fraction of all cells have strategy 1
    #   - single_s0:          single cell at the center has strategy 0
    #   - single_s1:          single cell at the center has strategy 1

    # The interaction matrix
    ia_matrix: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

    # The following parameters can also be given
    # They will always result in a Prisoners' Dillema situation
    # bc_pair: [1, 0]       # ignored if ia_matrix is given
    # b: 1.23               # ignored if either ia_matrix or bc_pair is given
