# The model configuration for the ForestFire model

# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single

# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make

grid_size: [501, 501]
periodic: true          # false: cells at boundary have fewer neighbors

# Initial state
initial_density: 0.5      # initial density of trees. value in [0,1].
                          # 0 corresponds to all empty, 1 to all trees

growth_rate: 7.5e-4       # probability per site to grow tree
