# The model configuration for the ForestFire model
# 
# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single
# instance. Therefore, parameter sweeps should not be specified here!
# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make
# sure that no circular includes occur.

grid_size: [512, 512]
periodic: true          # false: cells at boundary have fewer neighbors

# Initial state
initial_density: 0.2      # initial density of trees. value in [0,1].
                          # 0 corresponds to all empty, 1 to all trees

# parameter
growth_rate: 7.5e-3       # probability per site to grow tree
lightning_frequency: 1e-5 # probability per site to transit tree -> burning
light_bottom_row: false   # if true, bottom row permanently on fire - percolation model
resistance: 0             # probability to _not_ catch fire from neighbor per neighbor
