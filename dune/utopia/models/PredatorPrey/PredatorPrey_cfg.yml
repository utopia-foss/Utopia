# The model configuration for the SimpleEG model
#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration and needs to be
# written such that it can be used by _every_ model instance, regardless
# of the level within a model hierarchy.
# 
# To that end, it needs to specify the parameters at the level of the instance
# of a Model class.
# 
# This file is usually handled by the frontend: usage of advanced yaml features
# like anchors and tags is supported.
# 
# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single
# instance. Therefore, parameter sweeps should not be specified here!
# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make
# sure that no circular includes occur.

# Grid parameters
grid_size: [500, 500]
periodic: true          # false: cells at boundary have fewer neighbors

# Initial state
initial_state: random   # can be: random, fraction, single_s0, single_s1
prey_prob: 0.2            # only used for 'random' initial state
pred_prob: 0.285        # only used for 'fraction' initial state
# Explanation:
#   - random:             strategy 1 occurs with probability s1_prob
#   - fraction:           s1_fraction of all cells have strategy 1
#   - single_s0:          single cell at the center has strategy 0
#   - single_s1:          single cell at the center has strategy 1
# NOTE for the single-cell modes, both grid extensions need to be odd-valued

# Defining the interaction matrix through the benefit b:
delta_e: 2               
e_max: 200
e_min: 3
p_repro: 0.5
p_flee: 0.5
