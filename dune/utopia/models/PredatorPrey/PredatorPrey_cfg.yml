# The model configuration for the Predator-Prey model
#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration and needs to be
# written such that it can be used by _every_ model instance, regardless
# of the level within a model hierarchy.
# 
# To that end, it needs to specify the parameters at the level of the instance
# of a Model class.
# 
# This file is usually handled by the frontend: usage of advanced yaml features
# like anchors and tags is supported.
# 
# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single
# instance. Therefore, parameter sweeps should not be specified here!
# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make
# sure that no circular includes occur.

# Grid parameters
grid_size: [500, 500]
periodic: true          # false: cells at boundary have fewer neighbors

# Initial state parameters, each cell is populated randomly
prey_prob: 0.2         # probability to initialize as prey   
pred_prob: 0.285       # probability to initialize as predator


# Model specific parameters:
delta_e: 2   # resource increase by food uptake             
e_max: 200   # maximum resource level
e_min: 3     # threshold for reproduction
p_repro: 0.5 # probability to reproduce
p_flee: 0.5  # probability for prey to flee from predator if on same cell
