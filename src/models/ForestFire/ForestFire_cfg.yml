# The model configuration for the ForestFire model

# NOTE This file holds the _default_ values for a single instance.
#      Do NOT change the values here!

# Consult the documentation on how to change these parameters
---
# --- Space -------------------------------------------------------------------
space:
  periodic: true


# --- CellManager and cell initialization -------------------------------------
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 64           # cells per unit length of space's extent

  neighborhood:
    mode: vonNeumann         # can be: empty, vonNeumann, Moore

  # Initialization parameters for each cell
  cell_params:
    # With this probability, a cell is initialized as tree (instead of empty)
    p_tree: 0.2
    # NOTE Macroscopically, this is equivalent to the initial tree density


# --- Model Dynamics ----------------------------------------------------------
# Probability per site and time step to transition from state empty to tree
p_growth: 7.5e-3

# Probability per site and time step to transition to burning state, burning
# down the whole cluster
p_lightning: 1.0e-5

# Probability (per neighbor) to _not_ catch fire from a burning neighbor
p_immunity: 0.


# --- Heterogeneities ---------------------------------------------------------
# Some cells can be permanently ignited or turned into stones. Both are making
# use of the selection interface; consult the documentation for parameters.
# Both these features are using the `select_entities` interface; consult the
# documentation regarding information on available selection modes.

# Turn some cells into stones: these do not take part in any of the processes
stones:
  enabled: false
  mode: clustered_simple
  # NOTE Check the documentation for available selection modes.

  # Clustering parameters
  p_seed: .02                # Probability with which a cell is a cluster seed
  p_attach: .1               # Attachment probability (per neighbor)
  num_passes: 5              # How many attachment procedures to perform

# Set some cells on fire permanently (invoked after stones are set)
ignite_permanently:
  enabled: false
  mode: boundary

  # Boundary selection parameters (requires space to be set to NON-periodic!)
  boundary: bottom


# --- Output Configuration ----------------------------------------------------
# Whether to only write out the tree density; useful for runs on large grids
# where spatial information is not needed.
write_only_tree_density: false
