# --- Space -------------------------------------------------------------------
space:
  periodic: true


# --- CellManager and cell initialization -------------------------------------
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 128      # cells per unit length of space's extent

  neighborhood:
    mode: vonNeumann         # can be: empty, vonNeumann, Moore

  # Initialization parameters for each cell
  cell_params:
    # Initial tree density, value in [0, 1]
    # With this probability, a cell is initialized as tree (instead of empty)
    initial_density: 0.2


# --- Model Dynamics ----------------------------------------------------------
# Probability per site and time step to transition from state empty to tree
# Asymptotically, this can be seen as growth rate
p_growth: 7.5e-3

# Probability per site and time step to transition to burning state, burning
# down the whole cluster
p_lightning: 1.0e-5 

# Probability (per neighbor) to _not_ catch fire from a neighbor
p_resistance: 0.

# If set to true, the bottom boundary is constantly ignited. This _requires_
# the space to be set to non-periodic.
light_bottom_row: false
