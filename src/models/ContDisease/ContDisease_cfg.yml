# The model configuration for the ContDisease model
#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration and needs to be
# written such that it can be used by _every_ model instance, regardless
# of the level within a model hierarchy.
#
# To that end, it needs to specify the parameters at the level of the instance
# of a Model class.
#
# This file is usually handled by the frontend: usage of advanced yaml features
# like anchors and tags is supported.
#
# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single
# instance. Therefore, parameter sweeps should not be specified here!
# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make
# sure that no circular includes occur.

# --- Space parameters
# The physical space this model is embedded in
space:
  periodic: false

# --- CellManager and cell initialization
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 64      # in cells per unit length of physical space

  neighborhood:
    mode: Moore

  # Cell initialization parameters
  cell_params:
    # Initial tree density, value in [0, 1]
    # With this probablity, a cell is initialized as tree (instead of empty)
    initial_density: 0

# --- Model Dynamics
# Probability per site and time step to transition from state empty to tree
p_growth: 7.5e-3

# Probability per site and time step for a tree cell to become infected if an
# infected cell is in the neighborhood
p_infect: 1.

# Probability per site and time step for a random point infection of a tree cell
p_rd_infect: 0.

# Infection source - set true to activate a constant row of infected cells at
# the bottom boundary. Requires non-periodic space.
infection_source: true

# Stones - set true to activate.
stones: true

# Initialization mode for stones (can be: random)
stone_init: random

# Additional parameters for stone initialization
stone_density: 0.1   # stone density in entire grid
stone_cluster: 0.2   # how much stones prefer to form clusters
