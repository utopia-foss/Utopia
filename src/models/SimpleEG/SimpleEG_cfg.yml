# The model configuration for the SimpleEG model
#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration and needs to be
# written such that it can be used by _every_ model instance, regardless
# of the level within a model hierarchy.
# 
# To that end, it needs to specify the parameters at the level of the instance
# of a Model class.
# 
# This file is usually handled by the frontend: usage of advanced yaml features
# like anchors and tags is supported.
# 
# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single
# instance. Therefore, parameter sweeps should not be specified here!
# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make
# sure that no circular includes occur.

# -- Space parameters ---------------------------------------------------------
space:
  periodic: true          # false: cells at boundary have fewer neighbors

# -- CellManager --------------------------------------------------------------
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 63
  
  neighborhood:
    mode: Moore

# -- Cell initialization parameters -------------------------------------------
# Initial cell state mode
initial_state: random
# Possible values:
#   - random:             strategy 1 occurs with probability s1_prob
#   - fraction:           s1_fraction of all cells have strategy 1
#   - single_s0:          single cell at the center has strategy 0
#   - single_s1:          single cell at the center has strategy 1
# NOTE for the single_* modes, both grid extensions need to be odd-valued

# Probability for a single cell to have strategy S1 (used in 'random' mode)
s1_prob: 0.5

# Fraction of cells having strategy S1 (used in 'fraction' mode)
s1_fraction: 0.5

# -- Interaction --------------------------------------------------------------
# The parameters below all define the interaction matrix
# There are three ways to define it:
#   1) Explicitly setting the interaction matrix `ia_matrix`
#        S0      S1
#   S0 [ia_00  ia_01]
#   S1 [ia_10  ia_11]
#   
#   2) Setting a benefit and cost pair `bc_pair`
#        S0   S1
#   S0 [b-c   -c]
#   S1 [b      0]
#   
#   3) Setting the benefit parameter `b` following the paper of Nowak&May1992
#        S0    S1
#   S0 [1      0]
#   S1 [b(>1)  0]
#
# The most explicit parameter is chosen over the others.

# ia_matrix: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
# bc_pair: [1, 0]
b: 1.58
