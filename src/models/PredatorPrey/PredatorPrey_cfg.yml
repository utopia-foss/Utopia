# The model configuration for the Predator-Prey model
#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration and needs to be
# written such that it can be used by _every_ model instance, regardless
# of the level within a model hierarchy.
# 
# To that end, it needs to specify the parameters at the level of the instance
# of a Model class.
# 
# This file is usually handled by the frontend: usage of advanced yaml features
# like anchors and tags is supported.
# 
# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single
# instance. Therefore, parameter sweeps should not be specified here!
# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make
# sure that no circular includes occur.

# --- Space -------------------------------------------------------------------
space:
  periodic: true


# --- CellManager -------------------------------------------------------------
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 400      # in cells per unit length of physical space

  neighborhood:
    mode: Moore


# --- Model initialization ----------------------------------------------------
# Initial state mode
initial_state: fraction
# Available modes:
# 'random':   Each cell has a probability to be populated by a certain
#             species. The *_prob parameters control this.
# 'fraction': The number of cells of each species is calculated and these
#             cells are then randomly distributed on the grid. The *_frac
#             parameters are used to control the fraction of each species.
#
# Probabilities and fractions have to sum up to <= 1.0 and be greater than zero

# Initial resource levels for prey and predators
e_init_prey: 2.0
e_init_pred: 2.0

# Parameters for 'random' initialization
prey_prob: 0.2         # probability to initialize as prey   
pred_prob: 0.285       # probability to initialize as predator
predprey_prob: 0.3     # probability to initialize cell with predator and prey

# Parameters for 'fraction' initialization
prey_frac: 0.2         # fraction of cells to be initialized as prey
pred_frac: 0.285       # fraction of cells to be initialized as predator
predprey_frac: 0.0     # fraction of cells to be initialized as predprey


# --- Model dynamics ----------------------------------------------------------
# Model specific parameters
cost_of_living_pred: 1      # cost for a predator to uphold its structure
cost_of_living_prey: 1.    # cost for a prey to uphold its structure
delta_e_pred: 3             # resource increase by food uptake for the predator    
delta_e_prey: 3.            # resource increase by food uptake for the prey        
e_max_pred: 8             # maximum resource level of the predator
e_max_prey: 8.            # maximum resource level of the prey
e_min_pred: 4               # threshold for reproduction of the predator
e_min_prey: 4               # threshold for reproduction of prey
cost_of_repro_pred: 2      # resources transferred to offspring by predator (need be <=e_min)
cost_of_repro_prey: 2	  # resources transferred to offspring by prey (need be <=e_min)
p_repro_pred: 0.2           # predator's probability to reproduce
p_repro_prey: 0.2		 # prey's probability to reproduce
p_flee: 0.5            # probability for prey to flee from pred if on same cell
