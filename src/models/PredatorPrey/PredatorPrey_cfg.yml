# The model configuration for the Predator-Prey model
#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration and needs to be
# written such that it can be used by _every_ model instance, regardless
# of the level within a model hierarchy.
# 
# To that end, it needs to specify the parameters at the level of the instance
# of a Model class.
# 
# This file is usually handled by the frontend: usage of advanced yaml features
# like anchors and tags is supported.
# 
# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single
# instance. Therefore, parameter sweeps should not be specified here!
# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make
# sure that no circular includes occur.

# --- Space -------------------------------------------------------------------
space:
  periodic: true


# --- CellManager -------------------------------------------------------------
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 400      # in cells per unit length of physical space

  neighborhood:
    mode: Moore


# --- Model initialization ----------------------------------------------------
# Initial state mode
initial_state: fraction
# Available modes:
# 'random':   Each cell has a probability to be populated by a certain
#             species. The *_prob parameters control this.
# 'fraction': The number of cells of each species is calculated and these
#             cells are then randomly distributed on the grid. The *_frac
#             parameters are used to control the fraction of each species.
#
# Probabilities and fractions have to sum up to <= 1.0 and be greater than zero

# Initial resource levels for prey and predators
e_init_prey: 2.0
e_init_pred: 2.0

# Parameters for 'random' initialization
prey_prob: 0.2         # probability to initialize as prey   
pred_prob: 0.285       # probability to initialize as predator
predprey_prob: 0.3     # probability to initialize cell with predator and prey

# Parameters for 'fraction' initialization
prey_frac: 0.2         # fraction of cells to be initialized as prey
pred_frac: 0.285       # fraction of cells to be initialized as predator
predprey_frac: 0.0     # fraction of cells to be initialized as predprey
