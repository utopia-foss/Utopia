# --- Space -------------------------------------------------------------------
space:
  periodic: !is-bool true


# --- CellManager and cell initialization -------------------------------------
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: !is-positive 64

  neighborhood:
    mode: !param
      default: Moore
      is_any_of: [empty, vonNeumann, Moore, hexagonal]

  # Initialization parameters for each cell
  cell_params:
    # With this probability, a cell is initialized as tree (instead of empty)
    p_tree: !is-probability 0.2
    # NOTE Macroscopically, this is equivalent to the initial tree density


# --- Model Dynamics ----------------------------------------------------------
# Probability per site and time step to transition from state empty to tree
p_growth: !is-probability 7.5e-3

# Probability per site and time step to transition to burning state, burning
# down the whole cluster
p_lightning: !is-probability 1e-05

# Probability (per neighbor) to _not_ catch fire from a burning neighbor
p_immunity: !is-probability 0.


# --- Heterogeneities ---------------------------------------------------------
# Some cells can be permanently ignited or turned into stones.
# Both these features are using the `select_entities` interface; consult the
# documentation regarding information on available selection modes.

# Turn some cells into stones: these do not take part in any of the processes
stones:
  enabled: !is-bool false
  mode: !param
    name: selection mode for stones
    default: clustered_simple
    is_any_of: &selection_modes

      - probability
      - position
      - boundary
      - lanes

  # Clustering parameters
  p_seed: !is-probability .02     # Probability for a cell being a cluster seed
  p_attach: !is-probability .1    # Attachment probability (per neighbor)
  num_passes: !is-unsigned 5      # How many attachment procedures to perform

  # Depending on mode, can pass additional parameters here.

# Set some cells on fire permanently (invoked after stones are set)
ignite_permanently:
  enabled: !is-bool false
  mode: !param
    name: selection mode for permanently ignited cells
    default: boundary
    is_any_of: *selection_modes

  # Boundary selection parameters (requires space to be set to NON-periodic!)
  boundary: !param
    default: bottom
    is_any_of: [bottom, top, left, right, all]


# --- Output Configuration ----------------------------------------------------
# Whether to only write out the tree density; useful for runs on large grids
# where spatial information is not needed.
