# The model configuration for the ContDisease model
# 
# NOTE This file holds the _default_ values for a single instance.
#      Do NOT change the values here!
#
# Consult the documentation on how to change these parameters
---
# --- Space parameters --------------------------------------------------------
# The physical space this model is embedded in
space:
  periodic: false

# --- CellManager and cell initialization -------------------------------------
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 64      # in cells per unit length of physical space

  neighborhood:
    mode: vonNeumann

  # Cell initialization parameters
  cell_params:
    # Initial tree density, value in [0, 1]
    # With this probability, a cell is initialized as tree (instead of empty)
    p_tree: !is-probability 0

# --- Model Dynamics ----------------------------------------------------------
# Probability per site and time step to transition from state empty to tree
p_growth: !is-probability 7.5e-3

# Probability per site and time step for a tree cell to not become infected if
# an infected cell is in the neighborhood. This probability applies per event
# so it does _not_ mean that an immune cell is also immune in the next
# iteration step
p_immunity: !is-probability 0.

# Probability per site and time step for a random point infection of a tree
p_infect: !is-probability 0.
# NOTE This is affected by the infection control, see below.

# --- Infection Control -------------------------------------------------------
# Infection control to investigate the time-dependent influence of the 
# disease driving force. Note that infection control is applied at the
# beginning of an iteration step. It's effect is seen in the following
# time step
infection_control:
  enabled: !is-bool false

  # The number of additional infections to be placed on the grid
  num_additional_infections: !is-unsigned 10

  # Add the additional infections at the given times
  # Note the the !listgen tag creates a list from the parameters 
  # (start, stop, step_size)
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  at_times: !listgen [0, 100, 20]

  # Change the probability of a random infection.
  # The expected value is a list of [iteration_step, new_value] pairs, e.g.
  #   - [10, .5]
  #   - [42, 0.]
  # ... will set p_infect from the default value to .5 at time 10 and set it
  # back to 0. at time 42.
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  change_p_infect: []

# --- Heterogeneities ---------------------------------------------------------
# Some cells can be permanently infected or turned into stones.
# Both these features are using the `select_entities` interface; consult the
# documentation regarding information on available selection modes.

# Turn some cells into stones: these do not take part in any of the processes
stones:
  enabled: !is-bool false
  mode: clustered_simple

  # Clustering parameters
  # Probability with which a cell is a cluster seed
  p_seed: !is-probability .02
  # Attachment probability (per neighbor) 
  p_attach: !is-probability .1
  num_passes: !is-unsigned 5  # How many attachment procedures to perform

# Set some cells to be permanently infected (invoked after stones are set)
infection_source:
  enabled: !is-bool true
  mode: boundary

  # Boundary selection parameters (requires space to be set to NON-periodic!)
  boundary: bottom

# --- Output Configuration ----------------------------------------------------
# Whether to only write out the densities; useful for runs on large grids
# where spatial information is not needed.
write_only_densities: !is-bool false
