# The model configuration for the GameOfLife model
#
# This file should ONLY contain model-specific configuration and needs to be
# written such that it can be used by _every_ model instance, regardless
# of the level within a model hierarchy.
# 
# To that end, it needs to specify the parameters at the level of the instance
# of a Model class.
# 
# This file is usually handled by the frontend: usage of advanced yaml features
# like anchors and tags is supported.
# 
# Note, however, that this file should hold the _default_ values for a single
# instance. Therefore, parameter sweeps should not be specified here!
# Furthermore, if including other models' parameters via the `!model` tag, make
# sure that no circular includes occur.
---
# --- Space parameters
# The physical space this model is embedded in
space:
  periodic: true

# --- CellManager and cell initialization
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 128      # in cells per unit length of physical space

  neighborhood:
    mode: Moore

# --- Initialization 
# Initialize cells that should be set to living.
# This feature uses the `select_entities` interface; consult the
# documentation regarding information on available selection modes.
# Turn dead cells into living cells. All cells that do not fulfill the 
# condition are set to be dead.
living:
  mode: probability

  # Probability parameter
  probability: 0.1

  # Clustering parameters
  p_seed: .02            # Probability with which a cell is a cluster seed
  p_attach: .1           # Attachment probability (per neighbor)
  num_passes: 5          # How many attachment procedures to perform

# --- Rule specification
# Specify a rule in the notation used by Mirek's Cellebration as a string in
# in form `x/y` with:
#   - `x`: The number of neighbors required for a cell to get born
#   - `y`: The number of neighbors required to survive
# In this notation, the game of life is given as `3/23`
rule: 3/23
