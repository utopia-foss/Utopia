    structure: square

    mode: Moore

  # Cell initialization parameters

    # Initial susceptible density, value in [0, 1]
    # With this probability, a cell is initialized as susceptible (instead of empty)
    p_susceptible: 0.3

# --- Model Dynamics ----------------------------------------------------------
# NOTE that the default parameters below are chosen according to the
#      Covid-19 storyline roughly approximating the current knowledge, which
#      of course still changes and updates weekly (updated June 16th, 2020). 

# Probability per site and time step to transition from state empty to 
# susceptible. 
# As default, there are no randomly appearing susceptible cells coming into the 
# system.
p_susceptible: 0

# Probability to be immune per transition from an empty to a susceptible cell 
# via p_susceptible.
p_immune: *p_immune

# Cell specific probability to be transmit the disease per transition 
# from an empty to a susceptible cell via p_susceptible. This sets the cell 
# state `p_transmit` used in the model dynamics.
p_transmit: *p_transmit

# Probability per site and time step for a susceptible cell to not become infected if
# an infected cell is in the neighborhood. This probability applies per event
# so it does _not_ mean that an immune cell is also immune in the next
# iteration step.
p_random_immunity: 0.

# Probability per susceptible cell and time step for a random point exposure
# NOTE This is affected by the exposure control, see below.
p_exposure: 0.001

# Probability per exposed cell and time step to transition to infected state
# The default corresponds to a mean incubation period of 5 time steps
p_infected: 0.2

# Probability to recover if infected
# Note that p_recover + p_decease need to be smaller than 1
# The default is set to 1/14=0.0714, modeling that, on average, infection
# takes place for 14 days. 
p_recover: 0.0714

# Probability to desease if the cell is infected
# Note that p_recover + p_decease need to be smaller than 1
# The default is set to 2%, approximating the infection fatality rate 
# (see e.g. https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid for a rough 
# explanation).
p_decease: 0.02

# Probability per site and time step to transition to empty
# As default, there are no living cells vanishing by chance i.e. the system
# is approximated to be closed for the given time scales. 
p_empty: 0

# The probability to loose immunity if a cell is recovered
# This value is quite uncertain because it is not known whether and with what 
# probability immunity is lost in the case of Covid-19. Currently, the effect
# of losing immunity through virus mutation seem to be smaller then for the 
# common influenca virus with roughly one year. However, there are studies 
# suggesting that especially for light Covid-19 infections, new infections 
# can happen with a probably non-negligable rate. 
# The given default tries to roughly incorporate and estiate both effects.
p_lose_immunity: 0.01

# ... Movement ...............................................................
# Whether to allow cells to move away from infected neighboring cells
# If a neighbor is infected a cell searches for a random empty neighboring
# place and moves towards it. If there is no space do nothing
move_away_from_infected: false

# Probability to move in a random direction
p_move_randomly: 0.2

# --- Exposure Control -------------------------------------------------------
# Exposure control to investigate the time-dependent influence of the 
# disease driving force. Note that exposure control is applied at the
# beginning of an iteration step. It's effect is seen in the following
# time step
exposure_control:
  enabled: false

  # The number of additional exposures to be placed on the grid
  num_additional_exposures: 10

  # Add the additional exposures at the given times
  # Note the the !listgen tag creates a list from the parameters 
  # (start, stop, step_size)
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  at_times: !listgen [0, 100, 20]

  # Change the probability of a random exposure.
  # The expected value is a list of [iteration_step, new_value] pairs, e.g.
  #   - [10, .5]
  #   - [42, 0.]
  # ... will set p_expose from the default value to .5 at time 10 and set it
  # back to 0. at time 42.
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  change_p_expose: []

# --- Immunity Control --------------------------------------------------------
# Immunity control to investigate the time-dependent influence of actively  
# provided immunities. Note that immunity control is applied at the
# beginning of an iteration step but after the exposure control. It's effect 
# is seen in the following time step
immunity_control:
  enabled: false

  # The number of additional immunitys to be placed on the grid
  num_additional_immunities: 10

  # Add the additional immunities at the given times

  # (start, stop, step_size)
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  at_times: !listgen [0, 100, 20]

  # Change the probability of a random immunity when new susceptible cells 
  # appear through p_susceptible.
  # The expected value is a list of [iteration_step, new_value] pairs, e.g.
  #   - [10, .5]
  #   - [42, 0.]
  # ... will set p_immune from the default value to .5 at time 10 and set it
  # back to 0. at time 42.
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  change_p_immune: []

# --- Transmit Control --------------------------------------------------------
# Transmit control to investigate the time-dependent influence of actively  
# changing decease transmition probabilities. Note that transmit control is 
# applied at the beginning of an iteration step after the exposure and immunity 
# control. It's effect is seen in the following time step
transmit_control:
  enabled: false
  # Change the probability to transmit a decease of a number of randomly 
  # selected exposed or infected cells.
  # The expected value is a list of mappings
  # change_p_transmit: 
  #   - time: 10
  #     num_cells: 6
  #     cell_kind: susceptible
  #     p_transmit: 0.5
  #   - time: 42
  #     num_cells: 2
  #     cell_kind: exposed
  #     p_transmit: 0.
  # ... will set p_transmit from the default value to .5 for 6 randomly selected
  # susceptible cells at time 10 and set it to 0. for 2 randomly 
  # selected exposed cells at time 42. 
  # If num_cells exceeds the current number of present cells with the specified
  # kind all of them are chosen to reset their p_transmit value.
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.

# --- Heterogeneities ---------------------------------------------------------
# Some cells can be permanently infected or turned into stones.
# Both these features are using the `select_entities` interface; consult the
# documentation regarding information on available selection modes.

# Set some cells to be permanently infected (invoked after stones are set)
