# The model configuration for the SEIRD model
# 
# NOTE This file holds the _default_ values for a single instance.
#      Do NOT change the values here!
#
# Consult the documentation on how to change these parameters
---
# --- Space parameters --------------------------------------------------------
# The physical space this model is embedded in
space:
  periodic: false

# --- CellManager and cell initialization -------------------------------------
cell_manager:
  grid:
    structure: square
    resolution: 128      # in cells per unit length of physical space

  neighborhood:
    mode: Moore

  # Cell initialization parameters
  cell_params:
    # Initial susceptible density, value in [0, 1]
    # With this probability, a cell is initialized as susceptible (instead of empty)
    p_susceptible: 0.3

    # Initial immune density, value in [0, 1]
    # With this probability, a cell is initialized as immune, however, only if
    # it is susceptible (determined via p_susceptible)
    p_immune: 0.05

# --- Model Dynamics ----------------------------------------------------------
# Probability per site and time step to transition from state empty to susceptible
p_susceptible: 7.5e-3

# Probability to be immune per transition to susceptible via p_susceptible
p_immune: 0.1

# Probability per site and time step for a susceptible cell to not become infected if
# an infected cell is in the neighborhood. This probability applies per event
# so it does _not_ mean that an immune cell is also immune in the next
# iteration step
p_random_immunity: 0.

# Probability per site and time step for a random point exposure of a susceptible
p_exposure: 0.05
# NOTE This is affected by the exposure control, see below.

# Probability to recover if infected
# Note that p_recover + p_decease need to be smaller than 1
p_recover: 0.3

# Probability to desease if the cell is infected
# Note that p_recover + p_decease need to be smaller than 1
p_decease: 0.1

# Probability per site and time step to transition to empty
p_empty: 7.5e-3

# The incubation period for exposed cells to become infected
incubation_period: 5

# The probability to loose immunity if a cell is recovered
p_lose_immunity: 0.02

# ... Movement ...............................................................
# Whether to allow cells to move away from infected neighboring cells
# If a neighbor is infected a cell searches for a random empty neighboring
# place and moves towards it. If there is no space do nothing
move_away_from_infected: false

# Probability to move in a random direction
p_move_randomly: 0.01

# --- Exposure Control -------------------------------------------------------
# Exposure control to investigate the time-dependent influence of the 
# disease driving force. Note that exposure control is applied at the
# beginning of an iteration step. It's effect is seen in the following
# time step
exposure_control:
  enabled: false

  # The number of additional exposures to be placed on the grid
  num_additional_exposures: 10

  # Add the additional exposures at the given times
  # Note the the !listgen tag creates a list from the parameters 
  # (start, stop, step_size)
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  at_times: !listgen [0, 100, 20]

  # Change the probability of a random exposure.
  # The expected value is a list of [iteration_step, new_value] pairs, e.g.
  #   - [10, .5]
  #   - [42, 0.]
  # ... will set p_expose from the default value to .5 at time 10 and set it
  # back to 0. at time 42.
  # To disable, pass an empty sequence.
  change_p_expose: []

# --- Heterogeneities ---------------------------------------------------------
# Some cells can be permanently infected or turned into stones.
# Both these features are using the `select_entities` interface; consult the
# documentation regarding information on available selection modes.

# Turn some cells into stones: these do not take part in any of the processes
stones:
  enabled: false
  mode: clustered_simple

  # Clustering parameters
  p_seed: .02                # Probability with which a cell is a cluster seed
  p_attach: .1               # Attachment probability (per neighbor)
  num_passes: 5              # How many attachment procedures to perform

# Set some cells to be permanently infected (invoked after stones are set)
infection_source:
  enabled: false
  mode: boundary

  # Boundary selection parameters (requires space to be set to NON-periodic!)
  boundary: bottom

# --- Output Configuration ----------------------------------------------------
# Whether to only write out the densities; useful for runs on large grids
# where spatial information is not needed.
write_only_densities: false
